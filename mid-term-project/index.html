    <h2>Project Addendum</h2>
    <p><strong>Story Planning:</strong> The planning process involved creating a flowchart to map out each decision and path leading to different endings. This helped ensure all choices connected logically, creating an immersive experience.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Creative Choices:</strong> Inspired by the “Demon Slayer” universe, the game includes settings like forests, rivers, and ancient temples, adding to the atmosphere. Each path aligns with a “Demon Slayer” theme, such as bravery, teamwork, or stealth.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> One of the main challenges was keeping the branching paths coherent while maintaining excitement in each choice. Debugging each choice button was essential to ensure players reached the intended ending.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Insights Gained:</strong> This project provided insights into DOM manipulation, event handling, and debugging, especially in JavaScript. Creating the interactive user experience reinforced problem-solving skills.</p>
