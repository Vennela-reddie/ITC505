    <h1>SCENE I. London. The palace.</h1>
    <p class="stage-direction">Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others</p>

    <p class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
    <p>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,<br>
    Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,<br>
    And breathe short-winded accents of new broils<br>
    To be commenced in strands afar remote.<br>
    No more the thirsty entrance of this soil<br>
    Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;<br>
    Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,<br>
    Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs<br>
    Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,<br>
    Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,<br>
    All of one nature, of one substance bred,<br>
    Did lately meet in the intestine shock<br>
    And furious close of civil butchery<br>
    Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,<br>
    March all one way and be no more opposed<br>
    Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:<br>
    The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,<br>
    No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,<br>
    As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,<br>
    Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross<br>
    We are impressed and engaged to fight,<br>
    Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;<br>
    Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb<br>
    To chase these pagans in those holy fields<br>
    Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet<br>
    Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd<br>
    For our advantage on the bitter cross.<br>
    But this our purpose now is twelve month old,<br>
    And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:<br>
    Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear<br>
    Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,<br>
    What yesternight our council did decree<br>
    In forwarding this dear expedience.</p>

    <p class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
    <p>My liege, this haste was hot in question,<br>
    And many limits of the charge set down<br>
    But yesternight: when all athwart there came<br>
    A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;<br>
    Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,<br>
    Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight<br>
    Against the irregular and wild Glendower,<br>
    Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,<br>
    A thousand of his people butchered;<br>
    Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,<br>
    Such beastly shameless transformation,<br>
    By those Welshwomen done as may not be<br>
    Without much shame retold or spoken of.</p>

    <p class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
    <p>It seems then that the tidings of this broil<br>
    Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</p>

    <p class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
    <p>This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;<br>
    For more uneven and unwelcome news<br>
    Came from the north and thus it did import:<br>
    On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,<br>
    Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,<br>
    That ever-valiant and approved Scot,<br>
    At Holmedon met,<br>
    Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,<br>
    As by discharge of their artillery,<br>
    And shape of likelihood, the news was told;<br>
    For he that brought them, in the very heat<br>
    And pride of their contention did take horse,<br>
    Uncertain of the issue any way.</p>

    <p class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
    <p>Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,<br>
    Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.<br>
    Stain'd with the variation of each soil<br>
    Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;<br>
    And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.<br>
    The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:<br>
    Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,<br>
    Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see<br>
    On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took<br>
    Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son<br>
    To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,<br>
    Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:<br>
    And is not this an honourable spoil?<br>
    A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?</p>

    <p class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
    <p>In faith,<br>
    It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</p>

    <p class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
    <p>Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin<br>
    In envy that my Lord Northumberland<br>
    Should be the father to so blest a son,<br>
    A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;<br>
    Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;<br>
    Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:<br>
    Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,<br>
    See riot and dishonour stain the brow<br>
    Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved<br>
    That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged<br>
    In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,<br>
    And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!<br>
    Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.<br>
    But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,<br>
    Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,<br>
    Which he in this adventure hath surprised,<br>
    To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,<br>
    I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</p>

    <p class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
    <p>This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,<br>
    Malevolent to you in all aspects;<br>
    Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up<br>
    The crest of youth against your dignity.</p>

    <p class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
    <p>But I have sent for him to answer this;<br>
    And for this cause awhile we must neglect<br>
    Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.<br>
    Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we<br>
    Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:<br>
    But come yourself with speed to us again;<br>
    For more is to be said and to be done<br>
    Than out of anger can be uttered.</p>

    <p class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
    <p>I will, my liege.</p>

    <p class="stage-direction">Exeunt</p>
