    <h1>SCENE I. London. The palace.</h1>
    <p class="stage-direction">Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others</p>
    <p class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
    <p>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,<br>
    Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,<br>
    And breathe short-winded accents of new broils<br>
    To be commenced in strands afar remote.<br>
    No more the thirsty entrance of this soil<br>
    Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;<br>
    Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,<br>
    Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs<br>
    Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,<br>
    Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,<br>
    All of one nature, of one substance bred,<br>
    Did lately meet in the intestine shock<br>
    And furious close of civil butchery<br>
    Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,<br>
    March all one way and be no more opposed<br>
    Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:<br>
    The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,<br>
    No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,<br>
    As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,<br>
    Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross<br>
    We are impressed and engaged to fight,<br>
    Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;<br>
    Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb<br>
    To chase these pagans in those holy fields<br>
    Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet<br>
    Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd<br>
    For our advantage on the bitter cross.<br>
    But this our purpose now is twelve month old,<br>
    And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:<br>
    Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear<br>
    Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,<br>
    What yesternight our council did decree<br>
    In forwarding this dear expedience.</p>
    <p class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
    <p>My liege, this haste was hot in question,<br>
    And many limits of the charge set down<br>
    But yesternight: when all athwart there came<br>
    A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;<br>
    Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,<br>
    Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight<br>
    Against the irregular and wild Glendower,<br>
    Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,<br>
    A thousand of his people butchered;<br>
    Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,<br>
    Such beastly shameless transformation,<br>
    By those Welshwomen done as may not be<br>
    Without much shame retold or spoken of.</p>
    <p class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
    <p>It seems then that the tidings of this broil<br>
    Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</p>
    <p class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
    <p>This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;<br>
    For more uneven and unwelcome news<br>
    Came from the north and thus it did import:<br>
    On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,<br>
    Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,<br>
    That ever-valiant and approved Scot,<br>
    At Holmedon met,<br>
    Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,<br>
    As by discharge of their artillery,<br>
    And shape of likelihood, the news was told;<br>
    For he that brought them, in the very heat<br>
    And pride of their contention did take horse,<br>
    Uncertain of the issue any way.</p>
    <p class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
    <p>Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,<br>
    Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.<br>
    Stain'd with the variation of each soil<br>
    Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;<br>
    And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.<br>
    The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:<br>
    Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,<br>
    Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see<br>
    On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took<br>
    Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son<br>
    To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,<br>
    Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:<br>
    And is not this an honourable spoil?<br>
    A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?</p>
    <p class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
    <p>In faith,<br>
    It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</p>
    <p class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
    <p>Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin<br>
    In envy that my Lord Northumberland<br>
    Should be the father to so blest a son,<br>
    A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;<br>
    Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;<br>
    Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:<br>
    Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,<br>
    See riot and dishonour stain the brow<br>
    Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved<br>
    That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged<br>
    In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,<br>
    And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!<br>
    Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.<br>
    But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,<br>
    Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,<br>
    Which he in this adventure hath surprised,<br>
    To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,<br>
    I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</p>
    <p class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
    <p>This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,<br>
    Malevolent to you in all aspects;<br>
    Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up<br>
    The crest of youth against your dignity.</p>
    <p class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</p>
    <p>But I have sent for him to answer this;<br>
    And for this cause awhile we must neglect<br>
    Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.<br>
    Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we<br>
    Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:<br>
    But come yourself with speed to us again;<br>
    For more is to be said and to be done<br>
    Than out of anger can be uttered.</p>
    <p class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</p>
    <p>I will, my liege.</p>
    <p class="stage-direction">Exeunt</p>

    <h2>Addendum</h2>

    <h3>Font Choices</h3>
    <p>
        I selected Arial as the primary font for this scene because it is a clean and highly readable sans-serif font. Its simple, no-nonsense aesthetic ensures that the text remains clear and accessible while evoking a professional, timeless feel, aligning with the historical drama of Shakespeare’s text.
    </p>

    <h3>Heading and Text Sizes</h3>
    <p>
        The main heading (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) is set at 36px to emphasize the scene title, drawing immediate attention to its importance. The speaker names (<code>.speaker</code>) are differentiated by a slightly larger font size (18px) to clearly separate them from the dialogue. Line height is set to 1.6 to improve readability and allow adequate spacing between lines in dialogue.
    </p>

    <h3>Color Choices</h3>
    <p>
        The background color of the page is light beige (#f4f4f4), which mimics parchment paper, providing a classical and gentle backdrop that evokes a sense of history. The text is set in a dark charcoal (#333333), ensuring maximum readability without the stark contrast of pure black. Stage directions use a lighter gray (#777777) to subtly differentiate them from the dialogue, keeping the reader focused on the primary speech.
    </p>

    <h3>Margin and Padding</h3>
    <p>
        A margin of 20px is applied around the body to create enough breathing room on all sides of the page. Additionally, each paragraph has a 15px bottom margin to prevent text from looking congested, and a 20px indent for paragraphs provides a visual break between different speakers’ lines and actions. These spacing choices help make the script easy to follow and visually appealing.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML Structure Adjustments</h3>
    <p>
        Initially, I used <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for the scene heading, but this didn’t reflect the proper hierarchy of the document. I corrected this by changing it to <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, as it should represent the top-level heading. This adjustment improves both the semantic accuracy of the HTML and its accessibility, ensuring that assistive technologies can interpret the document structure correctly.
    </p>
<h3>Font Choices</h3>
<p>
    I chose Arial as the primary font for the webpage because it is a widely used sans-serif font known for its clean lines and excellent readability. This choice enhances the overall aesthetic of the page, making it approachable and professional.
</p>

<h3>Heading and Text Sizes</h3>
<p>
    The main heading (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) is set to a font size of 36px, which ensures that it stands out prominently at the top of the page. This large size draws the reader's attention immediately. The body text uses a line height of 1.6, providing ample spacing between lines to enhance readability and prevent visual clutter.
</p>

<h3>Color Choices</h3>
<p>
    The background color of <strong>#b1cc9f</strong> was selected for its soft green hue, creating a calming atmosphere. This choice contrasts well with the text, ensuring that it remains legible. The heading color is <strong>#002147</strong>, a deep navy blue that conveys a sense of authority and seriousness, aligning with the content's tone. The body text is black to ensure maximum contrast and readability.
</p>

<h3>Margin and Padding</h3>
<p>
    I implemented a 20px margin around the body of the page to create breathing space and prevent the text from feeling cramped against the edges of the screen. Each paragraph has a 15px margin at the bottom to separate them visually, enhancing the document’s structure. Additionally, a 20px text-indent for paragraphs gives a clear visual cue that a new paragraph has begun, improving the reading flow.
</p>

<h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
<p>
    In my original HTML, I used an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag for the main title based solely on its visual appearance. Upon reflection, I corrected this by changing it to an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, as it properly represents the highest-level heading in the document structure. This adjustment improves semantic meaning and accessibility, ensuring that screen readers can interpret the content correctly.
